				<span>
					<span>We now will speak no longer</span>
					<span>of the toil the maidens bore</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For knights as well as ladies.</span>
					<span>Queen Hilda evermore</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Her thoughts to this had given</span>
					<span>how to win back her daughter,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Out of the Norman kingdom,</span>
					<span>whither from home the daring Hartmut brought her.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>First were workmen bidden,</span>
					<span>near to the deep sea-flood,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of ships to build her seven,</span>
					<span>strong, well made, and good;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With two-and-twenty barges,</span>
					<span>broad, with both ends rounded.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Whate’er for them was needed</span>
					<span>was quickly brought, and everything abounded.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Forty galleys also</span>
					<span>lay upon the sea;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>On these her eyes were feeding.</span>
					<span>Longing great had she</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To see the throng of fighters</span>
					<span>who should soon be sailing.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>She their food made ready;</span>
					<span>for this the knights her praise were loudly telling.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The time was drawing nearer,</span>
					<span>when now to cross the sea</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>No more should they be waiting,</span>
					<span>who wished the maids to free,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That in a far-off kingdom</span>
					<span>in hardest toil were living.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Now Hilda sent for her liegemen;</span>
					<span>to those who called them clothes she first was giving.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The day that she had chosen</span>
					<span>was at the Christmas-tide,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>When they must seek the foemen</span>
					<span>by whom King Hettel died.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Forthwith to friends and kinsmen</span>
					<span>Hilda gave her bidding,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That they to bring her daughter</span>
					<span>back from the Norman land must then be speeding.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Trusty men were bidden</span>
					<span>by Hilda first to go</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To Herwic and his followers,</span>
					<span>that one and all should know</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of the inroad on the Normans</span>
					<span>that she had sworn and plotted.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To many Hegeling children</span>
					<span>this erelong an orphan’s life allotted.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The men sent out by Hilda</span>
					<span>to Herwic rode in haste:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For what they then were coming</span>
					<span>the king full quickly guessed;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then went he forth to meet them,</span>
					<span>soon as he saw them nearing;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Gladly them he greeted,</span>
					<span>and soon from them Queen Hilda’s wish was hearing.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>“Well you know, Lord Herwic,</span>
					<span>our woe and plight forlorn,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And how the Hegeling warriors</span>
					<span>to help the queen have sworn.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Yourself Queen Hilda trusteth</span>
					<span>more than any other;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To none Gu-drun is dearer⁠—</span>
					<span>the homeless maid, long sundered from her mother.”</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The well-born knight thus answered:</span>
					<span>“I know in truth too well</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>How Hartmut had the boldness</span>
					<span>my fair betrothed to steal,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Because his love she slighted,</span>
					<span>and hearkened to my wooing;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For this Gu-drun, my lady,</span>
					<span>her father lost, and still her lot is ruing.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>“My pledge and hearty greeting</span>
					<span>bear to your lady good;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>No more the Norman Hartmut</span>
					<span>by me shall be allowed</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To hold so long in bondage</span>
					<span>my own betrothèd maiden:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For me, of all, ’tis fittest</span>
					<span>to bring the lady home, our lives to gladden.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>“To Hilda and her kinsmen</span>
					<span>this answer you may say:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>When Christmas time is over,</span>
					<span>on the sixth-and-twentieth day,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I will ride to the Hegelings,</span>
					<span>three thousand fighters taking.”</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then the men of Hilda</span>
					<span>waited no more, but home their way were making.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Now Herwic made him ready,</span>
					<span>and to the strife gave thought,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With many faithful liegemen</span>
					<span>who oft had bravely fought.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Those who to go were willing</span>
					<span>he for war outfitted;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Though wintry was the weather,</span>
					<span>they to take the field no longer waited.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Of help the widowed Hilda</span>
					<span>sorely felt the need:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Soon to her friends in Denmark</span>
					<span>she sent her men with speed,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To tell the knights and warriors</span>
					<span>no more at home to tarry;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For they to the Norman kingdom</span>
					<span>must ride, to free Gu-drun from bondage dreary.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>They bore to the youthful Horant</span>
					<span>this errand from the queen:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That he and all his kinsmen</span>
					<span>were to her lord of kin,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And the sorrows of her daughter</span>
					<span>should by them be heeded;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For death to her were better</span>
					<span>than ever that her child to Hartmut should be wedded.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then sent the knight this answer:</span>
					<span>“Unto Queen Hilda say⁠—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Though yet ’twill cost to women</span>
					<span>many a bitter day,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I still, with all my followers,</span>
					<span>will help be gladly giving;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For this will be heard the weeping</span>
					<span>of many a mother’s child, in the land now living.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>“I bid you now, moreover,</span>
					<span>to say unto the queen⁠—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Ere many days are ended,</span>
					<span>in her land will I be seen;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Tell her that my wishes</span>
					<span>all to war are bending,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And soon ten thousand warriors</span>
					<span>from out the Danish land will I be sending.”</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The men sent there by Hilda</span>
					<span>of Horant took their leave:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They sped to the Waalisch marches,</span>
					<span>and found Morunc the brave</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With all his men about him,</span>
					<span>a margrave rich and daring.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He gladly saw them coming,</span>
					<span>and of a loving welcome was not sparing.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then spake the knightly Irold:</span>
					<span>“Since now by me ’tis known</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That into the Hegeling kingdom,</span>
					<span>before seven weeks are gone,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I with all my followers</span>
					<span>am bidden to be riding,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For this will I be ready,</span>
					<span>whatever luck be there for us betiding.”</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The news was spread by Morunc,</span>
					<span>within the Holstein land,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That Hilda now was sending</span>
					<span>for all her friends at hand;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He said that all good warriors</span>
					<span>must the field be taking.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To the Danish knight, brave Fru-te,</span>
					<span>they also gave the word, his help bespeaking.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The worthy knight, then answering,</span>
					<span>his ready will did show:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>“Back to her home will we bring her.</span>
					<span>Thirteen years ago,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>We swore the land of the Normans</span>
					<span>should with war be wasted;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>’Twas then the friends of Hartmut</span>
					<span>stole the maid Gu-drun, and homeward hasted.”</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Wâ-te, the knight from Sturmland,</span>
					<span>to this at once gave thought,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>How he might also help her.</span>
					<span>Altho’ he yet knew nought</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of the word that Hilda sent him,</span>
					<span>yet he at once bestirred him;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of his knights a goodly number</span>
					<span>then in haste he called, who gladly heard him.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>All of them were busy</span>
					<span>with care for the coming war;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Wâ-te the old from Sturmland</span>
					<span>brought from near and far</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Full a thousand kinsmen,</span>
					<span>for the fight well fitted;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With these he hoped that Hartmut</span>
					<span>would soon be overcome and be outwitted.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The sad and homeless women</span>
					<span>in toil and pain were kept</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By the cross and evil Gerlind:</span>
					<span>but fewer wrongs were heaped</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Upon the Lady Hergart;</span>
					<span>(this name to her was given:)</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>She loved the king’s high cup-bearer,</span>
					<span>and greatly hoped to be a princess even.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>For this fair Hilda’s daughter</span>
					<span>often sorely wept;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And Hergart, too, yet later</span>
					<span>woe and sorrow reaped,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Because she ne’er with others</span>
					<span>would their toils be sharing.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Whate’er to her might happen,</span>
					<span>Gu-drun for all her ills was little caring.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Of the Hegelings none were idle,</span>
					<span>as you before have heard:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Tho’ many for all their toiling</span>
					<span>would find but scant reward,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Yet all within the kingdom their</span>
					<span>ready help were lending.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Now the knights were thinking</span>
					<span>for the brother of Gu-drun ’twere best they should be sending.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Riders then went swiftly</span>
					<span>into the land of the North,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And found in an open meadow</span>
					<span>the youth of kingly birth,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Where by the edge of a river</span>
					<span>many birds were flocking:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>There with his trusty falconer</span>
					<span>he showed his skill, and spent his time in hawking.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>As soon as, riding quickly,</span>
					<span>these by him were seen,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He said: “Those men now coming</span>
					<span>are sent to us by the queen;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They come to give her bidding,</span>
					<span>proudly hither hasting;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>My mother thinketh wrongly</span>
					<span>that we the war forget, and time are wasting.”</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>He set his hawk a-flying,</span>
					<span>and thence at once he rode.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Very soon thereafter</span>
					<span>darkened was his mood;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For when the men he greeted,</span>
					<span>and they their tale were telling,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He learned that the queen, his mother,</span>
					<span>ever in tears her loss was aye bewailing.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>She to the youthful warrior</span>
					<span>sent her greeting kind:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>In her wretched lot, she asked him</span>
					<span>what might be his mind;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And asked how many followers</span>
					<span>he could to the war be leading;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For from the Hegeling kingdom</span>
					<span>they all to the Norman land must soon be speeding.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then Ortwin sent this answer:</span>
					<span>“Me dost thou rightly bid;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I from hence will hasten,</span>
					<span>and bring from far and wide</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Twenty thousand fighters⁠—</span>
					<span>men both brave and daring;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>These my steps will follow</span>
					<span>even to death, their lives and homes forswearing.”</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Now from every border</span>
					<span>many warriors went</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Riding to Hilda’s kingdom,</span>
					<span>for whom the queen had sent;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They vied with one another,</span>
					<span>to win her praises striving.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Not less than sixty thousand</span>
					<span>together came, their help for Hilda giving.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>On the river Waal Sir Morunc</span>
					<span>had upon the wave</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of broad-built ships full sixty,</span>
					<span>strong to bear the brave</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Who with the Hegelings sailing</span>
					<span>would o’er the sea be carried,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To free Gu-drun, the maiden,</span>
					<span>who sadly now among the Normans tarried.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>From out the Northland also</span>
					<span>finest ships were brought,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With horses and with clothing,</span>
					<span>as good as could be sought:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Decked were all the helmets,</span>
					<span>the weapons glittered brightly,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Ready for the onset</span>
					<span>bravely they came, in armor fair and knightly.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Now by their shields men reckoned</span>
					<span>how many there might be</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Who to the Norman kingdom</span>
					<span>would go the maid to free,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And to the great Queen Hilda</span>
					<span>their help to give were ready;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They numbered seventy thousand;</span>
					<span>gifts to all were given by the queenly lady.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>On all who there were gathered,</span>
					<span>or to court who later came,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The queen, though ever mournful,</span>
					<span>yet let her kindness beam:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>She gave them hearty welcome,</span>
					<span>and every one she greeted;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Wondrous was the clothing</span>
					<span>that to the chosen knights Queen Hilda meted.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The many ships of Hilda</span>
					<span>were stored with all things well,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And early on the morrow</span>
					<span>were ready thence to sail;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Seemly was the outfit</span>
					<span>for her worthy guests who waited:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They chose not to be going,</span>
					<span>while aught they lacked to meet the foeman hated.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>They put on board the weapons,</span>
					<span>as was the queen’s behest,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And with them many helmets</span>
					<span>of beaten steel the best.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Hauberks white were given,</span>
					<span>besides the ones in wearing,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For warriors full five hundred;</span>
					<span>these she bade them take, to war now faring.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Their anchor-ropes well twisted</span>
					<span>of strongest silk were made:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Their sails both rich and showy</span>
					<span>to the winds were spread;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>These to the shores of the Norman</span>
					<span>the Hegelings would carry,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Who back to Lady Hilda</span>
					<span>would gladly bring Gu-drun, of waiting weary.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The anchors for the sailors</span>
					<span>were not of iron made,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But of bell-metal moulded;</span>
					<span>(so have we heard it said:)</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They with Spanish brasses</span>
					<span>all were bound and strengthened,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That loadstones should not hold them,</span>
					<span>and so the sailors’ way by this be lengthened.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>To Wâ-te and his followers</span>
					<span>the Lady Hilda gave</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Many clasps and arm-bands.</span>
					<span>This roused the strong and brave</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To meet their death from foemen,</span>
					<span>for the Hegelings fighting,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>When they from Hartmut’s castle</span>
					<span>strove to wrest the maid, in bondage sitting.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Freely then and earnestly</span>
					<span>Queen Hilda spoke her thought</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Unto the men from Daneland:</span>
					<span>“When you have bravely fought</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>On the stormy field of warfare,</span>
					<span>I will reward you fitly.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Still my banner follow;</span>
					<span>that will show the way, and lead you rightly.”</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>They asked of her, who held it;</span>
					<span>to this then answered she:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>“He bears the name of Horant;</span>
					<span>a Danish lord is he.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>His mother, Hettel’s sister,</span>
					<span>she it was who bore him;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Let him by you be trusted;</span>
					<span>forsake him not in fight with foes before him.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>“Never, my hardy warriors,</span>
					<span>must you forget my son,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Young Ortwin, dear-belovèd,</span>
					<span>to manhood nearly grown.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of life the youth has numbered</span>
					<span>twenty years already;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If any risk should threaten,</span>
					<span>to guard him well then let your help be speedy.”</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>To this they pledged them gladly,</span>
					<span>and all together said,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>So long as they were with him</span>
					<span>nought had he to dread;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If he their lead would follow,</span>
					<span>those from whom he parted</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Again unharmed would see him.</span>
					<span>At this young Ortwin showed himself light-hearted.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Soon the ships were laden</span>
					<span>with goods of every kind,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And now to tell his wonder</span>
					<span>none fit words could find.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They asked good Hilda’s blessing</span>
					<span>on the work now undertaken;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The queen then begged of Heaven</span>
					<span>that they by Christ should never be forsaken.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Many youths went with them</span>
					<span>whose fathers erst were slain;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Now bereft, these brave ones</span>
					<span>to right their wrongs were fain.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The women of the Hegelings</span>
					<span>were mourning all and weeping,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Beseeching God in Heaven</span>
					<span>to bring them back their sons in his holy keeping.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>But all this pain and sorrow</span>
					<span>the warriors might not bear;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They sternly bade the women</span>
					<span>their bitter wails to spare;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then on their way they started</span>
					<span>in gladness, shouting loudly,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And as they went on shipboard</span>
					<span>all were heard to sing, and set forth proudly.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>After these daring sailors</span>
					<span>had cast off from the land,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Many sorrowing women</span>
					<span>did at the windows stand:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>From Matelan’s lofty castle,</span>
					<span>never the watch forsaking,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Their eyes the sea-path followed,</span>
					<span>as from the land the men their way were taking.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>A friendly wind was blowing,</span>
					<span>and loudly cracked the mast;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They the sails stretched tightly,</span>
					<span>and left the land at last.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The son of many a mother</span>
					<span>went, for honor seeking;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Though this awaited many,</span>
					<span>yet to gain it they must toil be taking.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>I cannot tell you fully</span>
					<span>of all that them befell,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Save that the lord of Karadie,</span>
					<span>who in that land did dwell,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With fighters came to help them,</span>
					<span>the foeman never fearing;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He from home brought with him</span>
					<span>ten thousand knights, all men of strength and daring.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Where foes upon the Wulpensand</span>
					<span>had met in deadly fray,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>These knights from many a kingdom,</span>
					<span>now, at this later day,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Chose the spot for meeting;</span>
					<span>and here they came together:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>A church had here been builded,</span>
					<span>and old and young alike had their gifts brought hither.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Now within its harbor,</span>
					<span>to seek their fathers’ graves,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Out of the ships here gathered</span>
					<span>went many of Hilda’s braves.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Bitter was their sorrow,</span>
					<span>and anger keen did waken;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Hard would it be for any</span>
					<span>who erst in fight the lives of their friends had taken.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Unto the lord of Moorland</span>
					<span>they hearty welcome gave.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Four and twenty broad-boats</span>
					<span>he brought with warriors brave;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Food therein was laden</span>
					<span>that might for all have lasted</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Till twenty years were ended:</span>
					<span>to war with the Normans now they gladly hasted.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>When they to sail were ready,</span>
					<span>they left the sheltering shore</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To make their way o’er the waters;</span>
					<span>but heavy toil they bore</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Upon the wild sea-billows</span>
					<span>before their sail was ended.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>What helped it that their leaders,</span>
					<span>Fru-te the Dane and Wâ-te, them befriended?</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>A wind from the south was blowing,</span>
					<span>and drove them out to sea.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The crew of warlike shipmates</span>
					<span>from fear no more were free;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They could not find the bottom,</span>
					<span>altho’ they should be casting</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Lengths of rope a thousand;</span>
					<span>many sailors wept, their lot foretasting.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Before the mount at Givers</span>
					<span>soon lay Queen Hilda’s host;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>However good their anchors,</span>
					<span>upon that gloomy coast,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Drawn by loadstones thither,</span>
					<span>they a long time rested.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Their masts so tough and hardy</span>
					<span>soon before their eyes were bent and twisted.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>When now the hopeless sailors</span>
					<span>were weeping o’er their lot,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Thus spoke the aged Wâ-te:</span>
					<span>“Anchors again throw out,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The strongest and the heaviest,</span>
					<span>into the sea unsounded.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I’ve heard of many wonders</span>
					<span>I would rather see, than here on the rocks be grounded.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>“Since, astray long sailing,</span>
					<span>our lady’s ships here lie,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And we so far are driven</span>
					<span>across the darkling sea,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I now will tell a sea-tale,</span>
					<span>that stirred my childish wonder,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of how, near the mount at Givers,</span>
					<span>a kingdom erst was built by a mighty founder.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>“Men there in wealth are living;</span>
					<span>so rich is all their land</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That under the flowing rivers</span>
					<span>silver is the sand;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With this they make their castles,</span>
					<span>and the stones are golden</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With which their walls are builded.</span>
					<span>In all the kingdom none in want are holden.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>“ ’Twas told to me, moreover,</span>
					<span>(by God are wonders wrought,)</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If one who by the loadstone</span>
					<span>unto this mount is brought,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Here will only tarry</span>
					<span>till the wind from the land is blowing,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He with all his kindred</span>
					<span>may be forever rich when homeward going.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>“Let us our food be eating</span>
					<span>until our luck shall turn,”</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Said then the aged Wâ-te;</span>
					<span>“before we hence are borne,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Our ships that here are lying</span>
					<span>shall with ore be loaded:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>When this we home shall carry,</span>
					<span>wealth shall we have that no one e’er foreboded.”</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then spake the Danish Fru-te:</span>
					<span>“A still, unruffled sea</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Shall never keep in idleness</span>
					<span>the men now here with me:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>A thousand times I swear to you,</span>
					<span>no gold would I be seeking,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But rather away from this mountain,</span>
					<span>with friendly winds, would I my way be taking.”</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The Christian men among them</span>
					<span>raised to Heaven a prayer;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But yet the ships ne’er yielded,</span>
					<span>strongly fastened there:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For four long days or over</span>
					<span>all their hopes were thwarted;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Sorely feared the Hegelings</span>
					<span>that they from thence could nevermore be started.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The clouds now lifted higher,</span>
					<span>as the mighty God had willed;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then no more they sorrowed,</span>
					<span>for soon the waves were stilled,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And from out the darkness</span>
					<span>the sun was shining brightly.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>A wind from the west was blowing,</span>
					<span>and now the woes were o’er of the wanderers knightly.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>For miles full six and twenty,</span>
					<span>past Givers’ craggy shore,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The ships at last were wafted.</span>
					<span>By this they saw yet more</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The work of God and his goodness,</span>
					<span>in all the help then given.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Wâ-te with his followers</span>
					<span>had been too near the rocks of loadstone driven.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>To smoothly flowing waters</span>
					<span>they now were come at last:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Their sins were not rewarded,</span>
					<span>and all their woes were past,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>While fear from them was taken,</span>
					<span>since God was not unwilling.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The ships that bore the warriors</span>
					<span>straight to the Norman land at length were sailing.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>But soon among the sailors</span>
					<span>arose again a wail;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For now the ships were groaning,</span>
					<span>and soon began to reel,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Tossed among the breakers</span>
					<span>that overwhelmed them nearly:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then said the brave knight Ortwin:</span>
					<span>“We now indeed must buy our honors dearly.”</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Outspake then one of the sailors:</span>
					<span>“Alas! and well-a-day!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I would we were at Givers,</span>
					<span>and dead near its mountain lay!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If one is by God forgotten,</span>
					<span>by whom is he befriended?</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>My brave and hardy warriors,</span>
					<span>the roar of the blustering sea is not yet ended.”</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then cried the knight, Sir Horant,</span>
					<span>he of the Danish land:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>“Be of good heart, brave fellows;</span>
					<span>I well can understand</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>This wind no harm will do us;</span>
					<span>from out the west ’tis blowing.”</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>This cheered the lord of Karadie,</span>
					<span>on him and on his men fresh hope bestowing.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Horant, the daring warrior,</span>
					<span>up to the topmast climbed,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And the widely stretching billows</span>
					<span>swept, with eyes undimmed,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Keeping for land an outlook.</span>
					<span>They soon his call were hearing:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>“Wait you now, unfearing;</span>
					<span>I see that we the Norman land are nearing!”</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The word to all was given,</span>
					<span>that they should lower sail:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Searching the waters over,</span>
					<span>they saw far off a hill,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Lofty, and thickly wooded,</span>
					<span>with groves and leafage shaded;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then old Wâ-te bade them</span>
					<span>thither to bend their way, and this they heeded.</span>
